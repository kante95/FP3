\section{Introduction}
As the title suggests, small amounts of Argon and Helium gas are transferred into vacuum where the expansion accelerates the atoms above the local speed of sound \cite{illinois}. The rapid expansion leads to a steep decline of particle density and therefore also in the collision rate. As a result the thermal equilibrium is temporarily lost, and different temperatures are needed to describe different degrees of freedom, which is an interesting phenomenon in physics. Furthermore, the adiabatic expansion leads to reduced internal energy, which results in low temperatures that has application in for example cluster physics, since it can be used to grow clusters.

\section{Theoretical background}
% I think we should expand this section whenever we use something in the analysis.
The theory presented in this section is based on the book "Gase, Nanosysteme, Flüssigkeiten" \cite{bergmann}. 

\subsection{Fundamentals}
In classical theory, gases consist of $N$ small, spherical particles  that are distributed in a space $V$. The density can then be calculated as $n = N / V$ and the mean distance is $a = n^{-\frac{1}{3}}$. The cross section can be defined as the area, which the center of a moving particle $a$ has to hit in order to collide with a resting particle $b$. If there is only one type of gas one can write 
\begin{equation}
	\sigma = 4 r^2 \pi =\pi d^2,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the hard sphere potential diameter or twice the van-der-Waals radius. For Argon a value of \SI{3.4}{\angstrom} \cite{bergmann} is used in the analysis. The mean free path $l$, which is the length an atom or molecule travels on average before colliding with another can finally be written as 
\begin{equation}
	l = \frac{1}{n \sigma} = \frac{k_B T}{\pi d^2 p},
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the pressure inside the vessel, $T$ is the temperature, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The last expression can only be applied to Boltzmann gases, which is the case for Argon and Helium in this experiment. \\
Another important quantity is the Knudsen number, which describes the ratio of the mean free path length $l$ of a particle and the characteristic length of the containing vessel $L$:
\begin{equation}
  K_n = \frac{l}{\sqrt{2} L} = \frac{k_B T }{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 p L}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Velocity distribution}\label{theory}
In the two final parts a look is taken at the distribution of velocities of particles in a gas pulse. According to \cite{bergmann}, the velocity in the gas pulse follows the floating Maxwellian distribution 
\begin{equation}\label{floatmaxwell}
	f(v) = C v^2 \exp(- \frac{m (v - u)^2}{2 k_\mathrm{B} T_\parallel}) = C v^2 \exp(\mathrm{S}_\parallel \left(1 - \frac{v}{u}\right)^2),
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass of an atom, $T_\parallel$ the longitudinal temperature, $\mathrm{S}_\parallel = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} m u^2 / (k_{\mathrm{B}} T_\parallel)}$ is the longitudinal speed ratio and $u$ is the mean velocity of the gas pulse. Finally $C$ is a normalization factor. The longitudinal temperature can be calculated from $S_\parallel$  as
\begin{equation}
T_\parallel = \frac{m}{2 k_\mathrm{B}} \left(\frac{u}{\mathrm{S}_\parallel} \right)^2.
\end{equation}
Furthermore the Mach number is defined as 
\[ M = \frac{u}{v_s},\]
where $v_s$ is the speed of sound in the gas given by $v_s = \sqrt{\gamma k_\mathrm{B} T/m}$ for an ideal gas, where $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index ($5/3$ for Argon or Helium). Speeds between $1.3$ and $5.0$ Mach number are said to be in the supersonic regime, which is where we expect our gas pulse to be.

\subsection{Plasma discharge}
A channeltron detector is used in this experiment, which means we need excited atoms to produce a signal, therefore excited Argon is produced by means of plasma discharge between two electrodes. Argon atoms collide with electrons during the discharge and are excited to a metastable state with an energy of almost \SI{12}{\electronvolt} according to \cite{script}. This should then be enough energy to cause the emission of a secondary electron in the electron multiplier, which is used as a detector. In Argon there are two metastable levels, which are in the $3\text{p}^54\text{s}$ shell with $J=0$ and $J = 2$, their lifetimes are \SI{40}{\s} and \SI{50}{\s} \cite{lifetime}, long enough for the atoms to travel and reach the detector before de-excitation. 

\section{Experimental setup}
The experiment consists of two main chambers. In the first one the input gas (i.e. Argon and later Helium) is contained. The pressure in the first chamber is not constant but is at a magnitude of a few \si{\bar} throughout the experiment. The second chamber is continuously emptied by a turbo-molecular pump, which is backed by a diaphragm pump. The chambers are connected via an orifice that is opened and closed by a piezo crystal. To vary the frequency and the time period of inlet one just has to accordingly modulate the electrical pulses on the piezo.
\newline
The open orifice allows for a small gas pulse to reach the vacuum chamber, where it can expand at supersonic speed. This leads to a change in the measured pressure inside the vacuum chamber, which is measured by a cold cathode ionization gauge \cite{cold_cathode}. To put it into simple terms, a DC voltage excites a discharge between two unheated electrodes (cathode and anode). Positive and negative charge carriers produced by collisions of electrons and gas particles move to their respective electrode and are detected. However, to properly use this method, one has to include a correction for the used medium, as different gases have different ionization behaviours.
\\
The output from the ionization gauge is a voltage, which is measured with an oscilloscope. To convert the voltage into pressure a formula given in the data sheet of the ion gauge \cite{datasheet_pfeiffer} is used
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq_pressure}
	p = K \exp(1.667 \times U - 9.333).
\end{equation}
Here, $U$ indicates the voltage signal that the gauge generates, while $K$ is a proportionality factor that corrects for the gas in use. The data sheet gives $K= 0.8$ for argon and $K = 5.9$ for helium. Eq. \ref{eq_pressure} takes the voltage in \si{\volt}, the resulting pressure is given in \si{\pascal}.
\\
While the pressure is measured at the top of the setup, another interesting thing is happening in the center. The pulse travels through two ring-shaped electrodes that are charged with a DC voltage. When there is enough gas in between the electrodes a plasma discharge is induced. This leaves both ionized and excited argon atoms in the pulse which can subsequently be detected with a channeltron detector.\\
Channeltrons work on the basis of electron multiplication. An atom with enough excitation energy causes a secondary electron to be emitted. The electron is accelerated by a voltage in the detector and causes the emission of several electrons when hitting the next electrode (often called dynode). This process can be repeated over several dynodes. Thus an easily measurable avalanche of electrons can be detected at the last dynode.
\\
The channeltron's signal is connected to a oscilloscope to visualize the measured data. Furthermore, the output of the ionization gauge and the voltage on the resistor on the electrode are fed into the oscilloscope.

\caption{Sketch of the experimental setup. Gas passes from the pressure chamber into the vacuum chamber in pulses, where the length and the frequency can be varied. The pressure is measured with the cold cathode ionization gauge. A direct voltage can be applied to the two ring electrodes, which causes a plasma discharge when gas passes through. The discharge can be detected by measuring the voltage on the resistor $R$. Finally the Channeltron detector can measure the intensity of atoms excited by the plasma discharge. }
\label{fig_setup}
\end{figure}
Since in this experiment one is mostly interested in the intensity of the excited argon atoms, the ionized argon atoms are seen as an unwanted interference in the detector's signal. Therefore the setup also has a deflection shield to divert the ionized argon atoms. However, in the experiment we found that varying the deflection voltage did not notably increase the quality of the received signal.

\section{Procedure and analysis}
\subsection{Pressure characteristics}
Starting off, a look was taken at the pressure characteristics of the setup. To be specific, the pressure in the vacuum chamber was measured for different frequencies and widths of the opening pulse. Measurements were performed on opening time windows with length \SI{120}{\micro \s}, \SI{190}{\micro \s} and \SI{230}{\micro \s} at frequencies of \SI{1}{\hertz}, \SI{2}{\hertz}, \SI{5}{\hertz} and \SI{10}{\hertz}. To measure the pressure in the pressure chamber a manometer on the inlet pipe was used. The indicated pressure did not notably change throughout this part of the experiment, which was approximately \SI{2.9}{\bar}. The results are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig_pressure_characterization} and Fig. \ref{fig_width_characterization}. Both figures show the same data, but in Fig. \ref{fig_pressure_characterization} the data is grouped according to frequency and in Fig. \ref{fig_width_characterization} it is arranged according to pulse width. As one can see in Fig. \ref{fig_pressure_characterization} the length of the pulse positively correlates with height of the pressure peak, i.e. the longer the pulse the higher the peak, which one would expect. However, the values of the ratio of the peak heights is clearly different than the ratio of the pulse length, which would be $1:1.56:1.92$. The ratio of the measured peaks however is approximately $1:40:69$. As the ratio between the second and the third number seems to be way closer to the ratio of the respective pulse widths it is probable that there is a time delay on the opening of the nuzzle, which causes less gas to pass then one would expect. Additionally, it would also explain why the difference shrinks with increasing opening time.

  \label{fig_pressure_characterization}
\end{figure}
Fig. \ref{fig_width_characterization} shows the same curves, but now curves with the same opening time are grouped up. The first thing one notices is that the higher the frequency is, the higher is the maximum value of the pressure curve. This one would expect because the vacuum pump can simply not sufficiently evacuate the vacuum chamber between the pulses as one can see for the \SI{5}{\hertz} and \SI{10}{\hertz} curves, meaning that there is additionally to the pulse a background pressure, which leads to a higher maximum. 
\\
However, one furthermore sees that the difference in the minimum to maximum pressure value also depends on the frequency. This is unexpected, as the opening width is the same in every plot in Fig. \ref{fig_width_characterization}. Apparently there is a systematic error that is connected to the frequency and the time width of the opening. %It was already mentioned that there is likely a delay in the opening. 
\\
In Fig. \ref{fig_pressure_characterization} and Fig. \ref{fig_width_characterization} we saw that both the frequency and the opening width influence the pressure span between minimum and maximum. Our idea to explain this is the following: in the script \cite{script} it says that the piezo closes the nozzle by pressing a rubber joint on the opening of the nozzle. It might be that the rubber joint sticks to nozzle, which would explain why there is a slight delay on the opening time. Furthermore, it is possible that the rubber sticks tighter to the nozzle the longer it is pressed to it by the piezo. This would also explain why the inlet of gas is higher the higher the frequency is. 

% Maybe we should take a look at the behaviour of maximum pressure and decay time \tau depending on frequency/width?

  \label{fig_width_characterization}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gas inlet per pulse}
Before the gas inlet is determined, we took a brief look at the Knudsen number within the used setup. The Knudsen number describes the ratio between the length of the setup $L = \SI{35}{\centi \m}$ and the mean free path of an Argon atom in the vacuum chamber, giving us essentially an average for the amount of collisions one has to expect during the expansion for one atom. 
\\
As Fig. \ref{fig_knudsennumber} shows, the Knudsen number is comparably high during the pulse. As one would expect, it reaches its minimum when the pressure peaks, but even then the value is still around $56$. This means that there should be hardly any collisions between atoms, meaning that the lack of thermalization should allow for a temporal loss of the thermal equilibrium. Therefore temperatures are expected to vary along different degrees of freedom. 
\\
According to \cite{illinois} the expansion should be adiabatic and therefore one uses the equation 
\begin{equation}
	P_i V_i^\gamma = P_f V_f^\gamma,
\end{equation}
where $P_i$ and $V_i$ are the initial pressure and initial volume inside the nozzle or the pressure chamber, while $P_f$ and $V_f$ are the final pressure and volume. We measured $P_i$ and we used $4\pm 1$ L for $V_f$ which is approximately the volume of the vacuum chamber. $P_f$ is extracted from the data as the maximum value of the peak. Therefore it is possible to find $V_i$ which is the gas inlet. In the following table the results can be found
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Gas inlet for various opening times and frequencies. }
\begin{tabular}{ccc} \toprule
    Gas inlet (mL) & Opening time (\si{\micro \s}) & Frequency (\si{\hertz}) \\ \midrule
0.0021 $\pm$ 0.0005 & 120& 1 \\
0.019 $\pm$ 0.005& 190& 1\\

	\label{fig_knudsennumber}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Pressure drop}
After the gas pulse, the pressure drop due to the gas been sucked up by the vacuum pump is looked at. We studied this drop by fitting an exponential decay of the form
\[f(t) = Ae^{-(t - t_0)/\tau} + C,\]
where $\tau$ is the parameter that gives the time scale of the decay, which we are interested in. All other parameters are not important in the analysis. An example of a fit can be seen in figure \ref{expfit}. Below a table with the time scale $\tau$ for every measurement we took
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Time scale for various opening time and frequency. }
\begin{tabular}{ccc} \toprule
    time scale $\tau$ (s) & Opening time (\si{\micro \s}) & Frequency (\si{\hertz}) \\ \midrule
$0.07028 \pm 0.0005 $& 120& 1\\
$0.0575 \pm 0.0002$& 190& 1\\

$0.0567 \pm 0.0002$& 230& 1\\\midrule
$0.0639 \pm 0.0004$& 120& 2\\
$0.0590 \pm 0.0005$& 190& 2\\
$0.0556 \pm 0.0002 $& 230& 2\\ \midrule
$0.116 \pm 0.008$& 120& 5\\
$0.089 \pm 0.004$ & 190& 5\\ 
$0.110 \pm  0.006$ & 230& 5\\\midrule
$0.17 \pm  0.02$& 120& 10\\ 
$0.19 \pm 0.03$ & 190& 10\\
$0.28 \pm 0.05 $ & 230& 10\\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
From the data we can notice that the time scale is larger for bigger frequencies and it seems that it does not depend on the opening time. Furthermore, we wanted to see if there is a dependence of the time scale on the gas inlet calculated in the previous section. This is plotted in figure \ref{gasinlettimescale}, but as we can see there is no apparent correlation between the two quantities.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{expfit}

\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{gasinlettimescale}
\caption{Time scale $\tau$ as a function of the gas quantity of the beam.}\label{gasinlettimescale}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Plasma discharge}
After studying the gas pulse, we tried to produce a plasma discharge. A power supply with a voltage of around 1000 V was attached to two ring electrodes as described in the experiment setup section. We fixed the opening time and frequency of the nozzle to 230 $\mu$s and 10 Hz. Then we tried to hit the gas at the right moment with a voltage pulse to produce a plasma discharge, this was done by varying the delay of the electric pulse. We took three measurements for three different widths of the pulse, which can be seen in figure \ref{discharge}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{discharge}
\caption{Voltage on the electrodes, the delay of the pulse was modified every time to hit the gas pulse.}\label{discharge}
\end{figure}

We can clearly see the plasma discharge by the characteristic bump in the voltage during the pulse. This means that we are able to hit the pulse and induce a plasma discharge in the gas.

\subsection{Channeltron characterization}
Before starting the main measurement, we had to characterize the detector. We tried to apply different voltages on the channeltron and analysed its signal. In figures \ref{channeltron}
one can see the measurements. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering{}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45 \textwidth}

  ~
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45 \textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{channeltron2}
    \caption{Channeltron voltage -1105 V}\label{channeltron2}
  \end{subfigure}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{channeltron3}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{channeltron5}
    \caption{Channeltron voltage -1405 V}\label{channeltron4}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{The green line is the electric pulse for the plasma discharge. The blue line is the signal from the channeltron. All measurements were taken with a voltage on the deflector of \SI{-5}{\volt}. }
  \label{channeltron}
\end{figure}
In every plot we can clearly see at least two peaks, the fist peak is due to particles like electrons and photons which are very fast, then after a while also the exited Argon atoms arrive and form the second large peak. In figure \ref{channeltron3} and \ref{channeltron4} a third peak between the two already described peaks appears, it is very low, almost imperceptible, but it can be seen and it is due to ionized Argon, which is accelerated by the electric field and therefore faster than excited Argon. Furthermore, in all plots of figure \ref{channeltron} but the first one, an overshoot can be seen, after the last peak the voltage of the channeltron does not come back to the value before the measurement but it goes higher, we notice also that the overshoot is bigger for lower channeltron voltage. This helped us to choose the correct voltage to use for the channeltron, in fact we should reduce the overshoot as much as possible, but still be able to see all the peaks. Moreover we also got an idea of the time of flight for the excited Argon, which can be seen from the plot to be around 0.5 ms.

\subsection{Argon lifetime and velocity distribution}
%Calculation of the velocity & Mach number
In the previous section, we identified the peak in the channeltron as excited Argon, in fact the excited Argon is in a metastable state, with a life time of \SI{40}{\s} or \SI{50}{\s}, depending on the state.\cite{lifetime}
We can then estimate the probability of an excited argon atom to decay before the detector is reached. This can be done with quite a simple integration, where we use the shorter life time:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{P} = \int_0^{t_f} \frac{1}{\tau} \exp(-\frac{t}{\tau}) \mathrm{d}t = 1 - \exp(-\frac{t_f}{\tau}) \approx 0.0012 \,\,\%

Therefore the excited Argon will likely reach the channeltron. To better analyze the excited Argon we isolated the corresponding peak and fitted a floating Maxwell distribution \eqref{floatmaxwell}. First the measurement was converted from a time domain to a velocity domain, simply by calculating the velocity as $v = d/(t-t_0)$, where $d = 30\pm 3$ cm is the distance between electrodes and detector, $t$ is the time, and $t_0$ is the initial time of the plasma discharge, so when the excited Argon is created. We took different measurements for different pressure and different opening time of the nozzle. In figure \ref{tof} the measurements with the fit are shown.

From the fit we can extract the parallel speed ratio, the average velocity, the longitudinal temperature, and the mach number as explained in section \ref{theory}. The following table summarizes our results

The errors in the table were estimated with the error on the length $d$, which is the biggest source of uncertainty. Therefore we fitted the data first using the lower bound $d = 27$ cm, then again with the upper bound $d= 33$ cm, and we averaged the two results of the two fits, so we wrote the error as the relative distance divided by two. From the Mach number we can see that we are indeed in the supersonic regime. Moreover, the longitudinal temperature is between 6 and 32 K which are expected temperatures according to \cite{illinois}. We also took measurements with an opening time of \SI{200}{\micro \s}, but the signal was to low to be analysed or simply not existent, therefore they have been neglected in this analysis.

\subsection{Helium velocity distribution}
We repeated the experiment with Helium instead of Argon, which is a lighter atom. Using the same procedure and the same analysis we obtained the velocity distribution in figure \ref{heliumtof}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{heliumtof}
\caption{Velocity distribution for helium, different curves are for different pulse width, red line is the calculated fit with the floating Maxwell distribution. The data has been multiplied by -1, to flip the peaks, which were actually dips in the recorded voltage.}\label{heliumtof}
\end{figure}\newpage
The results obtained from the fit are presented in the following table. 
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccccc} \toprule
Pressure (Bar) & Opening time (\si{\micro \s}) & $S_\parallel$ & $u$ (m/s) & $T_\parallel$ (K) & Mach number \\ \midrule
3.5 & 230 & 5.28 $\pm$ 0.04 & 553 $\pm$ 55 & 26 $\pm$ 5 & 1.73 $\pm$ 0.17 \\
3.5 & 220 & 4.76 $\pm$ 0.05 & 633 $\pm$ 63 & 42 $\pm$ 8 & 1.98 $\pm$ 0.19 \\\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{List of the fitting results from the time of flight measurement with Helium.}
\end{center}
\end{table}
We notice that we are again in the supersonic regime and the mean velocities, the Mach numbers, and the longitudinal temperature are greater with respect to Argon, since Helium is a lighter and therefore faster atom than Argon. 
The longitudinal speed ratio $S_\parallel$ seems to be about the same as the result we received for Argon, although it is difficult to make definitive statements with only two data points for Helium, that additionally have quite large errorbars. 
Finally, the longitudinal temperature $T_\parallel$ appears to be slightly higher in Helium than in Argon. This might be caused by helium being lighter and therefore have a bigger variance in velocity, which would corresponds to a higher temperature. 

\section{Conclusion}
In this experiment we studied supersonic gas pulses of Argon inside a vacuum chamber. First we analyzed the pressure behaviour of the gas pulses, then we induced a plasma discharge in the pulse in order to create metastable excited Argon that we can detect at the channeltron. We characterized the channeltron detector and finally measured the time of flight, which we used to study the velocity distribution of the pulse which revealed several features like longitudinal temperature, speed ratio, and Mach number. In addition to Argon, we also repeated the experiment with Helium and compared the results. As we expected the Helium pulse is faster then Argon and we also verified that the pulses travel at supersonic speed.
